        <h2>Performance Challenges in Oracle SQL Developer</h2>
        <p>When I worked with millions of records in Oracle SQL Developer, I encountered performance issues, especially when dealing with large datasets in queries. The primary challenge was that running complex aggregation queries, like the one I was working on, could take a long time to execute due to the sheer volume of data being processed. The system would become slow, and sometimes even run out of memory or crash during execution.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Handle Large Datasets</h2>
        <p>To handle this, I took several steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimized the Query:</strong> I ensured that the SALES_RECORDS table was properly indexed, especially on the columns being used in the GROUP BY (like REGION and ITEMTYPE). This helped speed up the grouping and sorting operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Used Partitioning:</strong> If the data was partitioned (e.g., by REGION or ITEMTYPE), I could improve query performance by limiting the scan to relevant partitions. This way, the system only processed a subset of the data at a time, instead of the entire table.</li>
            <li><strong>Filtered Data:</strong> In some cases, I filtered out unnecessary records before performing aggregations. For example, I could add a WHERE clause to only include sales records within a specific time range or region, reducing the size of the dataset being processed.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilized Temporary Tables:</strong> In certain cases, I created temporary tables to store intermediate results or perform calculations in stages. This allowed me to work with smaller, more manageable datasets at each step, rather than trying to process everything in one go.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importing a Large CSV File</h2>
        <p>As a sample, I worked on importing a large CSV file into an Oracle database. The file contained 5 million records and was 111.96 MB in size. I downloaded it from <a href="https://excelbianalytics.com/wp/downloads-18-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing-sales/">Excelbianalytics Portal</a>. After downloading the file, I used Oracle SQL Developer to import the data into the database. The process involved several steps, which I followed to ensure that the data was correctly loaded into Oracle. Below are the screenshots that illustrate how I performed the import process step by step.</p>

        <h2>SQL Queries for Analysis</h2>

        <h3>1. Total Revenue, Total Cost, Total Profit, and Total Orders by Region and Item Type</h3>
        <p>First, I tried to answer the question of how total revenue, total cost, total profit, and the number of orders varied by region and item type. To do this, I wrote the following SQL query:</p>
        <code>
            SELECT REGION, ITEMTYPE, 
                   SUM(TOTALREVENUE) AS Total_Revenue,
                   SUM(TOTALCOST) AS Total_Cost,
                   SUM(TOTALPROFIT) AS Total_Profit,
                   COUNT(ORDERID) AS Total_Orders
            FROM SALES_RECORDS
            GROUP BY REGION, ITEMTYPE
            ORDER BY REGION, ITEMTYPE;
        </code>

        </div>

        <h3>2. Count of Sales Records with More Than 100 Units Sold</h3>
        <p>Then, I tried to answer the business question of how many sales records had more than 100 units sold. The SQL query I used was:</p>
        <code>
            SELECT COUNT(*) 
            FROM SALES_RECORDS
            WHERE UNITSSOLD > 100;
        </code>

        </div>

        <h3>3. Top 5 Highest-Revenue Product Types by Region</h3>
        <p>For the top 5 highest-revenue product types in each region, I used the following SQL query:</p>
        <code>
            WITH Ranked_Products AS (
                SELECT REGION, ITEMTYPE, 
                       SUM(TOTALREVENUE) AS Total_Revenue,
                       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY REGION ORDER BY SUM(TOTALREVENUE) DESC) AS Revenue_Rank
                FROM SALES_RECORDS
                GROUP BY REGION, ITEMTYPE
            )
            SELECT REGION, ITEMTYPE, Total_Revenue
            FROM Ranked_Products
            WHERE Revenue_Rank <= 5
            ORDER BY REGION, Revenue_Rank;
        </code>
        <div class="img-container">

        </div>

        <h3>4. Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth in Revenue</h3>
        <p>To calculate the YoY growth in total revenue for each product type and region between 2015 and 2016, I wrote this query:</p>
        <code>
            SELECT REGION, ITEMTYPE,
                   SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR = 2015 THEN TOTALREVENUE ELSE 0 END) AS Revenue_2015,
                   SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR = 2016 THEN TOTALREVENUE ELSE 0 END) AS Revenue_2016,
                   (SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR = 2016 THEN TOTALREVENUE ELSE 0 END) - 
                    SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR = 2015 THEN TOTALREVENUE ELSE 0 END)) /
                   SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR = 2015 THEN TOTALREVENUE ELSE 0 END) * 100 AS YoY_Growth
            FROM SALES_RECORDS
            WHERE YEAR IN (2015, 2016)
            GROUP BY REGION, ITEMTYPE;
        </code>
