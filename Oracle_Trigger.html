        <p>I tried to answer the question of how to prevent the deletion of specific records in a database.</p>
        <p>This is needed to ensure that critical records could not be accidentally or intentionally deleted, which might have business or operational implications.</p>
        <p>As a sample scenario, I wanted to prevent the deletion of a department record in the DEPARTMENTS table under certain conditions (such as the one with <strong>DEPARTMENT_ID = 10</strong>).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Creating a Copy of the DEPARTMENTS Table</h2>
        <p>To implement this solution, I first created a copy of the <strong>DEPARTMENTS</strong> table and populated it with the existing data from the original table. This step ensured that I could test the functionality of the trigger without affecting the actual data in the production table.</p>
        
        <pre class="code-block">
<code>
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENTS_COPY AS SELECT * FROM DEPARTMENTS;
SELECT * FROM DEPARTMENTS_COPY;
</code>
        </pre>

    <section>
        <h2>Creating the Trigger</h2>
        <p>Next, I created an Oracle trigger called <strong>prevent_delete_department</strong> that fired before any delete operation on the <strong>DEPARTMENTS_COPY</strong> table. The trigger checked the <strong>DEPARTMENT_ID</strong> of the record being deleted. If the <strong>DEPARTMENT_ID</strong> was 10, the trigger would raise a custom error and prevent the deletion from happening.</p>
        
        <h3>Trigger Logic</h3>
        <p>The triggerâ€™s logic was as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the <strong>DEPARTMENT_ID</strong> of the record to be deleted was 10, the deletion was blocked by raising an exception with the message: <em>"Cannot delete department with ID 10"</em>.</li>
            <li>If the <strong>DEPARTMENT_ID</strong> was any value other than 10, the deletion was allowed to proceed.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre class="code-block">
<code>
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER prevent_delete_department
BEFORE DELETE ON DEPARTMENTS_COPY
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- If the department ID is 10, raise an exception to prevent deletion
    IF :OLD.DEPARTMENT_ID = 10 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Cannot delete department with ID 10');
    END IF;
END;
/
</code>
        </pre>

    <section>
        <h2>Testing the Trigger</h2>
        <p>After implementing the trigger, I tested it by attempting to delete records from the <strong>DEPARTMENTS_COPY</strong> table. The following outcomes were observed:</p>

        <h3>Test 1: Attempting to Delete Department with ID = 10</h3>
        <pre class="code-block">
<code>
DELETE FROM DEPARTMENTS_COPY WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 10;
</code>
        </pre>

        <h3>Query Execution Result</h3>

        <h3>Test 2: Attempting to Delete Department with ID = 20</h3>
        <pre class="code-block">
<code>
DELETE FROM DEPARTMENTS_COPY WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 20;
</code>
        </pre>
