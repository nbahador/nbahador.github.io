<p>In this code, I aimed to calculate and display the bonus of an employee based on their salary and commission percentage.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-bonus-does-an-employee-earn-">How much bonus does an employee earn?</h2>
<p>I wanted to calculate the bonus for a specific employee by using two key factors: their salary and their commission percentage.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-components-of-the-bonus-calculation-">What are the components of the bonus calculation?</h2>
<p>I needed to break down the bonus calculation into two parts:
10% of the salary
15% of the commission percentage</p>
<h2 id="how-i-did-that-">How I Did That:</h2>
<p>Declaring Variables: I started by declaring variables to store the data I would be working with: the employee&#39;s name (EMP_NAME), their salary (SAL), their commission percentage (COMM), and the calculated bonus (BONUS).</p>
<p>Retrieving Data: I used a SELECT INTO statement to fetch the necessary data (employee name, salary, and commission percentage) for a specific employee (with EMPLOYEE_ID = 157). This data was retrieved from the EMPLOYEES table and stored in the declared variables.</p>
<p>Calculating the Bonus: After fetching the data, I used simple arithmetic to calculate the bonus:
10% of the salary (SAL <em> 0.10)
15% of the commission percentage (COMM </em> 0.15). These two values were added together to compute the total bonus.</p>
<p>Displaying the Result: Finally, I used the DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE procedure to display the result in the output window. I concatenated the employeeâ€™s name (EMP_NAME) and the calculated bonus (BONUS) into a readable string.</p>
<p>To ensure the output was displayed correctly, I enabled the DBMS Output panel in SQL Developer and made sure to click the green &quot;+&quot; icon to enable output for the session. After running the PL/SQL block, I was able to view the output in the DBMS Output tab at the bottom of the window.</p>
